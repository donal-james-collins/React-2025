**Congrats, we made it!** âœ¨ Let's review this section.

1. We created a new project in Firebase, setting up authentication and a database.
2. We created a GitHub application to allow users to sign in to our application.
3. Our application is now configured to communicate with Firebase on the client-side.
4. We can sign in, sign out, and access user information through `useAuth`.
5. When a user logs into the application, we save their information to a `user` table in Firestore.
