### Accepting Payments

As a SaaS founder, you don't want to spend time on things you can outsource.
A perfect example is payments. Third-party services like [Stripe](https://stripe.com) take care of the complexity of accepting money on the internet and allow you to focus on your product.

For our product, we'll use [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout).
Checkout creates a secure, Stripe-hosted payment page that lets you collect payments quickly. It works across devices and is designed to increase your conversion.
Checkout saves you a lot of time providing some great features:

- **Designed to remove friction**â€”Real-time card validation with built-in error messaging
- **Mobile-ready**â€”Fully responsive design with Apple Pay and Google Pay
- **International**â€”Supports [15 languages](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-languages-for-stripe-checkout) and multiple payment methods
- **Customization and branding**â€”Customizable buttons and background color
- **Fraud and compliance**â€”Simplified PCI compliance and [SCA-ready](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication)
- **Additional features**â€”Collect addresses, send email receipts, and more
